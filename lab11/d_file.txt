Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has the public key of the browser.

The idea! The idea of RSA is 
based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is a multiplication 
of two large prime numbers. 
And private key is also derived from the same two p
\rime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies o
n the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 
1024 or 2048 bits long,



 but experts believe that 1024-bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.
